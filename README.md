# Dijkstra's Pathfinding Algorithm Visualizer

This project is a visualization tool for Dijkstra's Pathfinding Algorithm built with React. It allows you to visualize the working of Dijkstra's algorithm in an interactive way. 

You can create walls by clicking and dragging across the grid, and then click the "Visualize Dijkstra's Algorithm" button to see the shortest path from the start node to the end node.
